# What Is Dart

Dart is the programming language behind flutter, to help you develop on IOS, Android, Web and many others.

What's amazing about Dart, is that programming languages are either fast in compile time, and what that means is that you can iterate and make changes on your code faster and makes your life as a developer easy.
the other type of programing languages are fast in execution time compile, which makes the end user happy because the code gets compiled faster and improves the performance.

But Dart has a (JIT) Just in time compiler and an (AOT) ahead of time compiler, which makes it ideal for both developers and end users.

Dart is the only language that enables this across all different platforms!

Dart also is:

- Object Oriented: Structure the code inside classes
- Statically Typed: Helps us write code that is safe and more predictable
- C-Styled Syntax: Similar to popular programming languages such as Java and JavaScript
- Easy To Learn: You will find out!
