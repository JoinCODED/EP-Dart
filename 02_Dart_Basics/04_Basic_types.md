In the previous lesson we declared a variable with the `String` type, I bet you are wondering what other types we have in Dart.

The main basic types that you need to know is:

1. int
2. double
3. boolean

Let's see how to use them:

```dart
void main() {
    String name = 'Salem';
    int age = 24;
    double height = 178.2;
    bool lovesCoding = true;
}
```

Let's start with them one by one:

1. `int age = 24;` an `int` type is used for any number that doesn't have decimal places.
2. `double height = 178.2;` the `double` aka `float` is used for any number that has a fractional part.
3. `bool lovesCoding = true;` the `bool` aka `boolean` can be assigned two possible values, true and false.
