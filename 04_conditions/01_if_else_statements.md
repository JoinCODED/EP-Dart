In this and upcoming lessons, we will learn about conditionals in dart, which allows us to write code to make decisions based on some conditions.

Suppose you have an airplane tickets program, and you want to sell the ticket based on those conditions:

If the age is less than 18 you will charge 10KWD for the ticket
otherwise, if the age is more or equal to 60 you will charge 12KWD for the ticket
otherwise the ticket is worth 14 KWD.

Let's see how to code that in dart:

```dart
void main() {
    const age = 15;

}
```
